### Vision & Mission

#### Introduction
The steady advance of climate change is a global problem that requires global solutions. In view of the fact that the EU has set itself very high climate targets, which are constantly being increased, and that many non-EU countries have less stringent climate policies, there is a risk of carbon leakage. This occurs when companies based in the EU relocate their carbon-intensive production to countries with less stringent climate protection measures than in the EU, or when EU products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports.

To counteract this development, the EU has launched the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (short: CBAM). This is the EU's instrument for setting fair prices for carbon emissions from the production of carbon-intensive goods imported into the EU. It is also intended to promote cleaner industrial production in non-EU countries. 

By confirming that a price has been paid for the carbon emissions generated in the production of certain goods imported into the EU, the CBAM ensures that the carbon price for imports corresponds to the carbon price for domestic production and that the EU's climate targets are not undermined.

The CBAM will initially apply to imports of certain goods and selected inputs whose production is carbon intensive and where the risk of carbon leakage is highest: **cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizers, electricity and hydrogen**. With this expanded scope, the CBAM will eventually - when fully implemented - cover more than 50% of emissions in the sectors covered by the Emission Trading System (ETS). An expansion of the sectors is planned for the future. 


The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism will apply in its definitive regime from 2026, but the transitional phase, which will last between October 2023 and the end of December 2025, is already underway.


#### Vision
A transparent, interoperable, and sustainable industrial data ecosystem that empowers companies worldwide to accurately capture, share, and manage carbon emissions data for EU reporting.

#### Mission
Catena-X delivers a trusted, standardized data infrastructure that enables industrial stakeholders to seamlessly carbon emission data across global value chains. In the context of the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), this Catena-X CBAM KIT empowers companies to:

-	Collect and validate emissions data at the material and component level using harmonized methodologies.
-	Automate CBAM reporting workflows, reducing administrative burden and ensuring compliance with EU regulations.
-	Integrate upstream and downstream data from suppliers and partners, enabling accurate calculation of embedded emissions for imported goods.
-	Ensure data sovereignty and security, allowing companies to retain control over sensitive sustainability information while meeting transparency requirements.
-	Facilitate recognition of foreign carbon pricing schemes, supporting transparent treatment of non-EU producers.
-	Support strategic decision-making by providing actionable insights into emissions hotspots, cost implications, and optimization opportunities within the supply chain.
